Github fork creates a new copy of the master repository and associates it with your GitHub user ID.
Your fork can then be cloned to your local machine from the remote GitHub source.
Git clone is used after forking and copies the master repository.
It is a simple technical action that does not interact with the community of programmers working on the project.
After work has been completed on the clone, you need to send a pull request in order to merge back to the master.
Git branch is used to preserve the master branch code files and allow to continue work without disturbing the original.
Git branching can happen within your fork. Branching makes a new (lightweight) copy so that one can work on new features or bugs,
and then eventually merge the branch into the master, or the fork.
Git branching is great for project workflows that branch and merge often.
